# liquitecture

This is a project taking part at the [Coding da Vinci](https://codingdavinci.de) hackathon [Ost³](https://codingdavinci.de/de/events/ost3-2022).

## Description 
It's a 3D game. People will be able to walk through a part of Paris (which will be modelled based upon the tiff files from the data set). 
You will have to complete several tasks, for example: find a place, where Chopin lives. 
The reward for completing the task is seeing the musical notation of Chopin's music. 
Spoiler alert: You will also understand the name of the project, because it refers to the quote 
“Music is liquid architecture; architecture is frozen music” (quote is linked to Goethe, Schellenberg, and Schopenhauer). 
People will be able to play in the browser on their mobile phones and on their desktop browsers.
